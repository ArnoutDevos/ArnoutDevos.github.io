Going 0Ô∏è‚É£‚û°Ô∏è1Ô∏è‚É£ can be very hard but very rewarding: starting from an idea üå±, partnering up with my long-time collaborator Julia Wagner ü§ù, and in April 2023 successfully delivering the first ETH-EPFL Sciencepreneurship Summer School in Zurich, Switzerland, has been exactly such a rewarding journey! üöÄ

üî• This is a story of intersecting supportive #innovation communities and setting them up for #success. We succeeded in bringing together an exclusive but diverse group of 30 of the most entrepreneurial graduate #students from globally leading #universities with experienced #sciencepreneurs and ecosystem players.
