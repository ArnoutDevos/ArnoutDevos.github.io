At the end of March 2023, David Campbell and I were invited to give a 2 hour guest lecture in the [EPFL master's course MGT-413 Entrepreneurship & new venture strategy](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/entrepreneurship-new-venture-strategy-MGT-413). Specifically, lecturer [Davide Bavato](https://people.epfl.ch/davide.bavato/?lang=en) asked us to share hands-on how VCs evaluate startups and build investment memos to base base their decisions on.
