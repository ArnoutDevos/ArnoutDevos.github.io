At ETH AI Center, I led the development of AI Center Academic Talk Series (AICATS)! üò∫ This series is designed to foster meaningful connections and knowledge exchange between ETH AI Center's 100+ Faculty, 10+ Postdoctoral Fellows, 50+ Doctoral Fellows, 1000+ Associated Researchers, and the larger interdisciplinary AI research community. Held usually on academic semester Tuesdays, the talks offer a unique opportunity to share ongoing research, spark collaborations, and engage with peers over a networking lunch.

üìç Be there or be square
The core objective of this talk series is to stimulate in-person interaction in the ETH AI Center academic community, with a short talk format. So, there is usually no streaming or recording. Be there or be square! And, free pizza! üçï
