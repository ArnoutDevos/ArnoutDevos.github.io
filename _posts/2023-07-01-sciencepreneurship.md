Going 0️⃣➡️1️⃣ can be very hard but very rewarding: starting from an idea 🌱, partnering up with my long-time collaborator Julia Wagner 🤝, and last week successfully delivering the first ETH-EPFL Sciencepreneurship Summer School in Zurich, Switzerland, has been exactly such a rewarding journey! 🚀

🔥 This is a story of intersecting supportive #innovation communities and setting them up for #success. We succeeded in bringing together an exclusive but diverse group of 30 of the most entrepreneurial graduate #students from globally leading #universities with experienced #sciencepreneurs and ecosystem players.
