# Research interests
My research interests mainly revolve around `machine learning` (ML), where I focus on:
- ðŸŽ¯`few-shot learning`: **how can we transfer ML model task knowledge to related tasks, *efficiently*?**
  <!-- - Selected work: [RegressionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13613), [ProtoTransfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11325), [Genomic Meta-Learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20167-3) -->
- ðŸ¤–`automated machine learning`: **how can we *reduce human input* in ML model design & training?**
  <!-- - Selected work: [MALTML](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v148/devos21a), [Reproducing R2D2 & MAML](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJx0N2I6IN) -->
- ðŸŽ²`probabilistic modeling`: **how can we *incorporate uncertainty* in modeling data processes?**
  <!-- - Selected work: *forthcoming* -->

Previously, I have also worked on research and published in the area of ðŸ’¡`analog circuit design`. So, you could say I am really a full-stack researcher from silicon hardware up to AI software!
