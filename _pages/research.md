# Research interests
My research interests include:
- `few-shot learning`: *how can we transfer knowledge efficiently from one task to another related task?*
- `probabilistic modeling`: *how can we model data generating processes and derive insights?*
- `automated machine learning`: *how do we reduce human-required input for model configuration?*

Previously, I have also worked on research and published in the area of analog circuit design. So, you could say I am really a full-stack researcher from silicon hardware up to AI software!
