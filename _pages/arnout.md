👋 Hi, I am Arnout, a final year PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at <a style="color:red;" href="https://ic.epfl.ch"><b>EPFL</b></a>🇨🇭, and a Marie-Curie fellow 🇪🇺.

**Research** interests include few-shot learning and automating machine learning. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.scholar_userid }}" title="Google Scholar"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i> Google Scholar</a> lists all my research papers.

**Innovation** & **education** are other passions. Examples include: building the independent student VC fund [S2S Ventures](https://www.s2s.vc/), joining the entrepreneurial PhD program [EPFLinnovators](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/epflinnovators-arnout-devos/), and co-founding the [ETH-EPFL Sciencepreneurship Summer School](https://sciencepreneurship.ch).

**Previously**, I obtained my MS in CS at <a href="https://www.usc.edu" style="color:#E74C3C;">USC</a> 🇺🇸, as a <a href="https://baef.be/baef-fellows/#2017"  style="color:#3498DB;">BAEF</a> fellow, and MS/MS/BS in Management/EE/EECS at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be" style="color:#3498DB;">KU Leuven</a> 🇧🇪.
I have been an intern at <a href="https://research.atspotify.com/" style="color:green;">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.science/" style="color:darkorange;">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/" style="color:#E74C3C;">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rfic/" style="color:red;">EPFL</a>, and <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/" style="color:#3498DB;">Siemens</a>. For more, check my profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}" title="LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn</a>. A detailed resume/CV is available upon request.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
