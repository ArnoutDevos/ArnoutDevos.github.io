👋 Hi, I'm Arnout, a staff member at [ETH AI Center](https://ic.epfl.ch) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu). There, I'm active in interdisciplinary AI research & education, including in generative AI & innovation. Personally, I'm also passionate about accelerating deep tech entrepreneurship through our global [Sciencepreneurship Community](https://sciencepreneurship.ch), consisting of (aspiring) entrepreneurial scientists and ecosystem players.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Machine Learning in 2024 from [EPFL](https://ic.epfl.ch), as a [Marie-Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellow, and got their Teaching Assistant award. I co-founded an AI EdTech startup and then I built up student Pre-Seed VC fund [S2S Ventures](https://s2s.vc), where I led its first 4 investments (deploying over $250k) with so far 1 successful exit ([Digit Soil](https://www.digit-soil.com/)) and 2 Seed rounds ([Adaptyv Bio](https://www.adaptyvbio.com/), [MAIA](https://en.getmaia.ai/)).

Longer ago, I obtained my MS in CS in 2018 at <a href="https://www.usc.edu" style="color:#E74C3C;">USC</a> 🇺🇸, as a [BAEF](https://baef.be/baef-fellows/#2017) fellow, and my MS/MS/BS in Management/EE/EECS in 2017 at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be" style="color:#3498DB;">KU Leuven</a> 🇧🇪. I have been an intern at <a href="https://research.atspotify.com/" style="color:green;">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.science/" style="color:darkorange;">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/" style="color:#E74C3C;">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rfic/" style="color:red;">EPFL</a>, and <a href="https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/" style="color:#3498DB;">Siemens</a>.

Although I speak proficient French, basic German, and native Dutch, I strongly prefer US English, the [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) of [Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). A detailed CV is available upon request. I'm open to consulting & advising engagements.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
