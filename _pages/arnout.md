👋 Hi, I'm Arnout, a staff member at [ETH AI Center](https://ic.epfl.ch) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu). There, I'm active in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research & education, including generative AI & innovation. Personally, I'm also passionate about accelerating deep tech innovation, including with our global [Sciencepreneurship Community](https://sciencepreneurship.ch) of entrepreneurial scientists.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Machine Learning in 2024 from <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" style="color:red;">EPFL</a>, as a [Marie-Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellow, and got their Teaching Assistant award. I have been a research intern at <a href="https://research.atspotify.com/" style="color:green;">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.science/" style="color:darkorange;">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bmir.stanford.edu/" style="color:#E74C3C;">Stanford</a>, and <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/rfic/" style="color:red;">EPFL</a>. I co-founded an AI EdTech startup and I built up student Pre-Seed VC fund [S2S Ventures](https://s2s.vc). I led its first 4 investments (deploying $250k) with so far 1 successful exit ([Digit Soil](https://www.digit-soil.com/)) and 2 Seed rounds ([Adaptyv Bio](https://www.adaptyvbio.com/), [MAIA](https://en.getmaia.ai/)).

Longer ago, I obtained my Master's in Computer Science (CS) in 2018 from <a href="https://www.usc.edu" style="color:#E74C3C;">USC</a> 🇺🇸, as a [BAEF](https://baef.be/baef-fellows/#2017) fellow. I also obtained degrees in Management, Electrical Engineering (EE), and EECS from <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be" style="color:#3498DB;">KU Leuven</a> 🇧🇪.

Detailed CV at request. Note that, although I speak proficient French 🇫🇷, basic German 🇩🇪, & native Dutch 🇳🇱, I strongly prefer to communicate in English 🇺🇸. I'm open to consulting & advising engagements.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
